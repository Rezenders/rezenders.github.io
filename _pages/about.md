## Gustavo Rezende Silva

I am a PhD Candidate at [Robot Dynamics Section](https://www.tudelft.nl/3me/afdelingen/biomechanical-engineering/research/dbl-delft-biorobotics-lab/) as part of the [Department of Cognitive Robotics](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/3me/departments/cognitive-robotics-cor/), [Faculty of Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering (3mE)](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/3me/), [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/). More specifically I am the Early Stage Researcher (ESR) [#8](https://remaro.eu/index.php/positions/#position8) in the European Training Network (ETN) for Reliable AI for Marine Robotics ([REMARO](remaro.eu)) with a Marie Skłodowska-Curie fellowship.

My PhD goal is to push the state-of-art of self-adaptation for autonomous robots, more specifically underwater robots, endowing them with the capability to adapt their control architecture during their operation, improving their _reliability_, _flexibility_ and _explainability_. I am interested in robotics, underwater robots, autonomous agents, and knowledge-based reasoning.

### Research keywords
 _autonomous systems, control architectures, self-adaptive systems, robot software, knowledge representation and reasoning_

### Short Bio

I have a master's degree in Automation and Systems Engineering from the [Federal University of Santa Catarina](https://pgeas.ufsc.br/en/). My research was about active perception within BDI agents reasoning cycle, and the application of BDI agents to program robots intelligence. I used simulated UAVs as testbed, utilizing ROS, ardupilot, px4, gazebo, and Jason to achieve this goal.

And I have a degree in Mechatronics Engineering from the Federal University of Uberlândia. During college, I had experience with humanoid robots, wheeled robots, computer vision, precision agriculture, and web development.
